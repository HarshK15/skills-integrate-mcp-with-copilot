## Running the example MCP endpoints

This repository includes a minimal MCP-like provider implemented as two HTTP
endpoints in `src/app.py`:

- `GET /mcp/context` ‚Äî returns a small set of project files (for use as model
	context)
- `GET /mcp/summary` ‚Äî returns a compact project summary

To run the app locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn src.app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Then try the MCP endpoints:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/mcp/summary | jq
curl -s http://localhost:8000/mcp/context | jq '.files | keys'
```

This is a small, safe example meant for learning; a production MCP provider
should include authentication, careful filtering of file contents, rate
limiting, and other protections.
